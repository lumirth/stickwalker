# Third-party material and tools

The [references](references.md) describe the research and tools that inform this project.

The compiler archive reader in `tools/installshield.py` uses the InstallShield format and
block-decoding approach documented by [ISx](https://github.com/lifenjoiner/ISx)
and [Unshield](https://github.com/twogood/unshield). Their MIT notices follow.

[Wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo) is downloaded separately from its
upstream release, or supplied locally. uv, Ninja, Pillow, Ruff, clang-format and Cppcheck retain their own licenses.
The Python dependencies are recorded in `uv.lock`.

The NCG/NCL converter follows public format descriptions in
[NitroPaint](https://github.com/Garhoogin/NitroPaint) and
[Tinke](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke). The [artwork guide](../assets/README.md)
links the consulted revisions and explains the reconstructed editor metadata.

## Renesas HEW device header

[`include/startup/iodefine.h`](../include/startup/iodefine.h) is the retained
Renesas HEW device-register template. It identifies itself as **H8/38602 Series
Include File, Ver 2.1**, with the marker **HEW_2006.10.05**. It provides the
memory-mapped register declarations used by the firmware.

This vendor template is outside the project's CC0 dedication. Its existing
identification is retained in the file, and automated formatting and line-ending
conversion exclude it. The retained file contains no standalone license grant;
the project adds no license grant over Renesas's material.

## Stickwalker runtime

The Stick build uses M5Stack's ESP32 board package **3.3.9**,
[M5Unified 0.2.21](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified/tree/0.2.21) and
[M5GFX 0.2.29](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX/tree/0.2.29).
The two M5 libraries use MIT; their full notices are retained in
[`stick/licenses/`](../stick/licenses/). The Arduino ESP32 core contains
LGPL-2.1-or-later material, and its underlying ESP-IDF, precompiled libraries
and components retain their own terms. These runtime libraries are downloaded
separately and are outside this project's CC0 dedication. See the pinned
[M5 board package](https://github.com/m5stack/arduino-esp32) and
[ESP-IDF license](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/v5.5/LICENSE).

The candidate firmware archive is a local qualification artifact. Before
public binary distribution, assemble the linked runtime's applicable notices,
corresponding source and relinking materials; the source archive alone does not
contain the Arduino/ESP-IDF dependency sources or application object files.
[Release qualification](../stick/docs/release.md) tracks this packaging gate.
