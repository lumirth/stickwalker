## Acknowledgments

UnrealPowerz's [pw_firm](https://github.com/UnrealPowerz/pw_firm/tree/main/)
inspired the matching reconstruction. h4lfheart's
[PocketWalker](https://github.com/h4lfheart/PocketWalker) inspired the initial
Pokéwalker work. Dmitry Grinberg's hardware and firmware research laid much of
the groundwork.

The [Pokéwalker Hacking community](https://discord.gg/ymbTMsS), including
mamba2410, zenithknight, mriancamp, porocyon and its other contributors, provided
research, tools and a place to compare findings. The projects and authors linked
above also contributed to the reconstruction's technical foundations.

## Stick hardware and runtime

The port uses M5Unified 0.2.21, M5GFX 0.2.29 and ESP-IDF 5.5 interfaces from
the pinned M5Stack board core. These sources support the adapter contracts
and debugging procedures, rather than measurements of this firmware's runtime.
